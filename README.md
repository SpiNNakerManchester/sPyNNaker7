NO LONGER SUPPORTED 
===================

The sPyNNaker code based has moved on to use PyNN 0.9 and Neo 0.6

Therefore we no longer support sPyNNaker7. 

The repositories for this can be found at [sPyNNaker8](https://github.com/SpiNNakerManchester/sPyNNaker8)

The new model templates for sPyNNaker8 can be found at [sPyNNaker8NewModelTemplate](https://github.com/SpiNNakerManchester/sPyNNaker8NewModelTemplate) 

For help converting existing models (ideally to sPyNNaker8/ PyNN 0.9) please contact the Spinnaker team.
